## Why screen candidates

We'd love to see all candidates face to face. We'd love to have a
complete view of their background, character and abilities before
making a hiring decision. In practice, it's almost impossible for
organisations to commit this sort of time.

More importantly, we don't want to take up the candidate's time if we
think there's a low probability we're going to hire them. They're busy
people too. They're generally in employment, and if they're in Job
Hunt Mode then they'll often have multiple job applications live at
any given time.

Done right, screening gives you and the candidate a way of building
confidence in each other - as your investment in each other grows, so
does your confidence.

I want to emphasise that this needs to be a **matched investment**. At
**every stage**, the candidate needs to feel they know more about you,
in the same way you know more about them. If this investment becomes
unbalanced, then trust is eroded, and however appealing your job ad
was, you're back to sending a signal that this is really just about
your company and its requirements.

Also remember that screens are just that. I talk to experienced
developers who find the process that companies put in place wearying
and burdensome. In some cases they'll make a choice to go with
companies who have a simpler and faster selection process.

This is not because they're lazy people, but because they're busy
people. In-demand developers will just not have the time for your
6-stage process spread over two months. You need to keep it lean and
efficient. You can keep loading on more tests and assessments, but
you'll just have fewer people engaged in the process. You won't get to
the finish line with the best candidates, you get there **with the
ones that are left**.

## T-shapes and technical specifics

A theme that's going to be running through this and the next article
is that we should look for breadth. This "T-shaped" model of personal
and professional development is often used to illustrated the point.

TODO: diagram

Now, it's just a model, and shouldn't be taken literally, but it does
ring true for me. Before I even knew this existed, whenever I was
asked what the difference was between a beginner developer and a
proficient, experienced developer, I'd always reply "breadth and
depth", and I'll be returning to that phrase in a minute.

You might have quite exacting requirements - specific experience you
need, or specific tech skills that can't easily be picked up.

For most of the next two posts, I'm going to have to make some
assumptions. There's an almost infinite variety of technical
backgrounds that might be important to you, and I don't want to be
constantly issuing caveats.

So, here's my assumption : if you're hiring experienced developers
with a specific skillset, I'll assume you're smart people, that you
know about the technical domain you're hiring for, and that you can
apply good judgement as to whether the candidate has the right
experience or not. We'll look at the broader picture in these posts.

## And you...do you code?

If you're not hands-on with development, you need to be hands-off with
developer hiring. Non-developers just aren't in a position to assess
developer skills, and their uncertainty and lack of confidence in code
will mean they'll focus on other traits. Most likely they'll focus on
**the wrong traits**.

This isn't elitism, it's just a reflection of the challenge of the
role. The way we hire people now needs participation from the
interviewer, not just observation. So, it doesn't matter that you
_used_ to code, what matters is whether you code now. The easiest way
to check is to do the online test, the assignment, or the live
interview challenge yourself.

If it's a struggle for you, it's time to take a step back and let
others participate, and make the call when it comes to the hiring
decision. Hopefully you've heeded my advice and got as many people in
your team involved in technical interviewing as you can. If you
haven't, then start.

## CV and cover letter

For each candidate, there's only one question that needs answered at
this stage : "Can I picture this person working as part of our
team?". That's it. I try to blot the rest of the selection process out
of my mind - it's a simple, standalone decision about a single
candidate.

If the answer is "yes", or "maybe", I'll have a phone conversation. If
the answer is "no", or "it's really unlikely" then the best thing for
the candidate is to give them as much feedback as you can, and let
them concentrate on their other job applications. I'll talk much more
about feedback in the third and final post.

TODO: hard requirement

Putting aside the technical specifics, here are some things I view as
strong positives in a CV, that would make me want to know more about a
candidate:

- Breadth and depth : breadth is a multiplier - people with breadth
  add capability to teams far beyond their core skills. If you're
  hiring developers, look for signs of interest in other disciplines -
  test automation, in product design and broad industry knowledge.

- Self-improvers : evidence of personal or open-source projects is
  great, as well as attendance at any local meetups or conferences. I
  like to see people who are engaged in a wider technical community,
  although I have some important caveats on this later. Initiatives,
  experiments and innovation that people do on the job are things I
  always see as signs of self-improvement too.

- Coaches : I'm reassured when I see some signs that this person helps
  other people, because it gives me a good sense of how someone is
  going to work in a team : coaching, mentoring, helping children or
  adults learn to code, anything. This can start in the earliest
  stages of a career, too, it's not something just for more
  experienced developers. Any signs that people are keen to share
  their knowledge and expertise - at whatever level - are attributes
  to look out for.

- Ethical developers : you want to hire developers who care about
  their users, customers, and colleagues. If I see some indications
  that developers are motivated by making things better for people,
  this makes me happy. This could be adoption of better test-driven
  approaches, more secure code to protect users, more efficient code
  to improve battery life on a user's device, improving readability
  and clarity of code for their colleagues.

- Bias for action : it's something of a Silicon Valley term, but it's
  widely applicable in tech as a desirable trait. You want people who
  are going to try things, measure how they work, learn, and
  adapt. Look for evidence that people run spikes, experiments and
  proofs-of-concept, and that they change their approach depending on
  results. Software development is full of uncertainty, but analysis,
  whiteboarding sessions and endless discussions do little to reduce
  the uncertainty. Build, measure, learn.

## Personal projects and meetups : a note of caution

Although it's great to see evidence of personal projects on GitHub or
elsewhere, remember that this can be a lot easier for some people than
others.

It's important to gauge this from a diversity standpoint. People with
a lot of discretionary time can work on personal projects, make open
source contributions, and attend meetups and conferences. However,
people with childcare or eldercare commitments often can't, and these
commitments tend to fall disproportionately on women. Also remember
that some technical communities are far less inclusive than others,
and it would be egregious to penalise women engineers for the
exclusionary behaviour of others.

In those cases where candidates do have these projects and activities,
sure, view them as positives, but always remember that personal
circumstances play a part.

And if you're a male, white, middle-class technical manager,
understand that your experience and perception of tech communities are
very likely to be different - perhaps wildly different - from the
experience of women, LGBTQ+ and non-binary folks and people of colour
who work in that same technical field.

- Treat personal projects and tech community involvement as "more
  information about candidate \<a>", and not "this makes candidate
  \<a> a better prospect than candidate \<b>".

## Phone screens

Phone screens used to be quite the big thing: **Technical Interview
Lite**, effectively. Typically these would be short calls, and you'd
be armed with a set of technical questions. These questions were
supposed to be sure-fire ways of choosing the best candidates to go
forward to the next stage.

I've used them that way in the past, in Q&A mode, but always found
them stilted, awkward and ineffective, and I think candidates did
too. It's a strange sort of conversation, barking questions apropos of
nothing into a mouthpiece. Good candidates blank and stumble over
answers when they don't have context. Other candidates will have
memorised every Google search result for "technical interview phone
screen questions", and wing it, sometimes convincingly.

I still think there are merits to phone, Skype or Hangouts contact
though. It's a chance to check in with the candidate, let them know
there are actual human beings involved on your side of the process,
and that they're regular developers too. They also give the candidate
a chance to ask questions about the company, your technology, culture
and teams. _A matched investment_.

Although I still value phone screens, I do these very differently
now. I use a much more conversational style, and tend to base
questions around a candidate's *stated* experience rather than a list
of *requirements* for a role. I use that as a jump-off into some
technical discussion.

With this approach, you follow the trail of the discussion, and spot
opportunities to ask some technical questions along the way. It's more
natural, tends to flow better, and you get a more accurate impression
of the candidate to base decisions on. What I'm looking for at this
stage is consistency rather than probing for very deep knowledge and
experience. The knack to this is to make the segue from general
discussion about past experience into more technical discussion as
unforced as possible, using the cues the candidate themselves give
you.

This is a much harder format for the interviewer to run than having a
set question list - for one thing, you need to have good
conversational skills yourself, and you also need to be able to show
the same genuine enthusiasm and interest you're expecting the
candidate to show. It needs you to think on your feet, but I think you
get a better feel for the candidate.

- Use a phone screen as a chance to introduce yourselves to each
  other, and to make sure the candidate is OK with the process. Be
  human. Be informal. Chat. Don't try to play a role.

- Focus on what candidates say they know in their CV or cover letter,
  rather than what you think you need.

- Use a conversational style based around the experience on their
  CV. Follow the trail, and improvise. Get in some technical questions
  that are relevant to the context as the conversation develops.

- Ask a mix of open and closed questions. You want to see how the
  candidate communicates, not just in terms of technical accuracy, but
  whether there's any genuine passion and enthusiasm for the subject.

- It doesn't need to be highly technical: you're going to have some
  other tech screening mechanism. It's an introduction and a
  consistency check above all.

- Non-sequitur technical questions are just awkward. Good candidates
  experience brain freeze, and others wing it.

- Be wary of hyper-confidence by the candidate. You're looking to hire
  self-aware, reflective people who learn as they go. A career
  presented by the candidate as an unbroken series of ever more
  glorious successes makes me very nervous, because I work in software
  development too and have a decent understanding of what the reality
  looks like. It may be nerves, or it may be something else entirely.

- Keep these around 20 minutes. With practice, you'll develop the
  ability to get a good read on the candidate in this time.

- Do these calls in pairs to give a balanced view. Remember from the
  first post the point about diversity in your pool of interviewers?
  This is a point in the process where diversity of opinion matters,
  and give thought to who should primarily lead the conversation, and
  who should primarily listen.

When you get to the end of the screen, and discuss with your
co-interviewer, talk around these points:

- We talked to this candidate because we could picture them working
  with us. Is that still the case after speaking with them? More so,
  or less so?

- Did everything seem consistent? Did the narrative we got from the
  candidate correspond to what we read on the CV?

- When we asked technical questions, did the answers seem consistent
  with the experience that was being described? Were there any obvious
  gaps? Were there answers that were obviously wrong?

- Did the candidate seem comfortable talking about the work they'd
  done, or did they hesitate? Did they try and steer the conversation
  away from technical questions?

- Did we get a sense of enthusiasm and excitement about the technical
  domain, and also the role and our company?

- Now, allowing for the candidate being nervous, would we change our
  view on any of these points above?

And make your decision : "Based on what I now know about this
candidate, do I think it's more likely or less likely that we'd hire
them

## Online technical test platforms

Online technical assessment tools like HackerRank and Codility are
becoming more widespread in hiring. I understand why companies are
using them, although I think they're used either wrongly or
excessively more often than not.

TODO: mechanisms and measures

These platforms seem to provide an objective measure of capability, to
differentiate between candidates. After all, the intent of HackerRank
is to Rank your Hackers, is it not? 

I see this all the time in software development - and not just in
hiring - this urge to reduce something complex, nuanced and difficult
to understand down to a dashboard metric. Numbers and measures are
seductive - they promise simple answers and absolute truths. 

They way these tools tend to be used by organisations, though, makes
them an example of the Streetlight Effect in action [Source -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect):

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a
> streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his
> keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few
> minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the
> drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman
> asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where
> the light is."

Just because there's light to see by, it doesn't mean you're looking
in the right place. These tools measure what can be measured, but not
necessarily what's important. Here's where we really want to look, at
the things that have the biggest bearing on whether your code turns
out to be an asset or a liability for your organisation:

- Changeability and maintainability of code.

- Clean code and simple design.

- Ability to find a solution by working collaboratively in pairs, and
  in teams.

- Working in small increments, driven by tests.

- Readability and naming in the code.

There's no tool that's going to assess these things accurately, but it
turns out that humans are pretty good at it. Any automated tool you
decide to use works by assessing the characteristics of _code_, not of
people. They're proxy measures at best, and not always useful ones.

And remember that point earlier about matched investment? That the
candidate should learn as much about you as you learn about them?
Well, all they learn with these tools is that you're happy to have a
machine run this part of your recruitment for you.

- Don't sleepwalk into outsourcing your technical interview to an
  online platform. Some aspects of hiring are _just hard work_, and
  you need to be prepared to put in the personal effort with
  candidates as part of the live interview for the more challenging
  parts of your tech selection.

- If you need to run a coding assessment online, consider using the
  excellent CyberDojo instead : a platform that emphasises test-driven
  development, working in small increments.

- If algorithmic problem solving is central to the sort of work you
  do, sure, I understand why these tools might be attractive. But
  there are better ways of running interviews around CS algo and data
  structure fundamentals. And really, if that's the main focus in the
  role, should it not be the centrepiece of the live interview? More
  in the next post on that.

- If you absolutely must use a tool like HackerRank, at least build
  your challenge sensibly. Rather than off-the-shelf coding
  challenges, consider creating your own. Use a (small!) mix of
  multiple choice, subjective questions and a coding challenge at the
  simpler end of the spectrum.

- Remember, this should never be the main event, just the warm-up
  act. Size it appropriately. There's a "yay, add to basket!"
  mentality that some technical interviewers suffer from when they're
  creating these tests, but you're not doing your organisation any
  favours by making this excessive. Be **very generous indeed** on the
  time allowance - creating a false sense of urgency for the candidate
  is unrealistic, pointless, stressful and ultimately
  counterproductive.

- Whatever you decide to use as a code challenge, make sure to
  communicate what's important to you in code. Simplicity? Clarity?
  Naming? Size? It's your choice, but let the candidate know. No
  surprises.

- If beat-the-clock coding challenges are appealing to you because you
  want people "working quickly" to meet arbitrary deadlines, I
  respectfully suggest you have other things you need to be thinking
  about before you hire anyone.

TODO : how to assess

## Coding assignments

If you need to scale up your technical screening, for most
organisations this will be a better way than the online route.

There are many benefits. For one thing, you can set a challenge that's
a better fit for the core skillset of the role you're recruiting
for. A small website for web developers. A simple library with tests
for a C++ developer. A single-screen mobile application for iOS or
Android developers. A RESTful service for back-end Java developers.

You can communicate with candidates. While they're doing this too.

TODO GH reviews

TODO comms with candidate

TODO how to run

You construct a challenge that could be completed in 2-4 hours, and
send to the candidate.

  less experienced graduates will take far, far longer to complete a
  challenge like this. Create one that's

TODO what to look for

TODO feeding into tech interview

## "Aptitude" tests

Some organisations do psychometric evaluations or "aptitude
testing". These are numerical, inductive, and verbal reasoning tests,
and - spoiler alert - are absolutely nothing to do with real-world
aptitude in software development.

I've no idea why organisations do these, and I strongly suspect they
don't either. If someone can show from their experience that they've
worked as part of a team in delivering solutions to complex problems,
and their screening and technical interview shows they can write good
code, I'd say their grey matter is working pretty well for them.

They're used also in assessing the potential of graduate entrants to
companies, the rationale being that recent graduates don't have a work
history or easily demonstrable skills to draw on. What graduates do
have, though, is a very recent and detailed record of academic
attainment, so I still find this puzzling.

I don't get it. Perhaps my inductive reasoning isn't all it should
be. But still, hard pass.

## A better pipeline

TODO: diagram showing balance assessment

TODO: standup

If you're looking for an online silver bullet that will lighten the
load of screening and interviewing candidates, well...there is one,
but it's probably not the one you think. Sorry.

There are tools out there that will give you a superficial sense of
better efficiency, but they all come at a high cost, and it's not
financial, it's human.

In the end, the solution to being better at hiring, is to get better
at hiring. Not a tool.
