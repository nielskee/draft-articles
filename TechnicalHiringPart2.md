* Why Screen
We'd love to see all candidates face to face. We'd love to have a
complete view of their skills, background and abilities. In practice,
it's almost impossible for organisations to commit this sort of time.

We also don't want to take up the candidate's time if we think there'a
low probability we're going to hire them. They're busy people
too. They're generally in full time employment, and they'll often have
multiple job applications live at any given time.
* CV and Cover Letter
At this stage, I'm trying to decide whether I want to have a
conversation with the person. A phone screen takes about 15-20
minutes, so I'm not going to spend 30 minutes agonising over that
decision. 

Your might have quite exacting requirements - specific experience you
need, or specific tech skills that can't easily be picked up. You
might be hiring someone specifically to help you bootstrap you into a
new technology.  Whatever the situation, you're going to know in about
5 minutes with a CV and cover letter whether you're looking at a
viable candidate or not.

Putting aside your tech specifics, here are some things I view as
positives in a CV, that might make me want to have a conversation with
them. These are mine.

- Breadth

- Curiosity 

- Self-improver. Evidence of personal or open-source projects,
  attendance at meetups and conferences, and engaged in their
  community.

- Coach : some signs that they help other people : coaching,
  mentoring, helping kids or adults learn to code. This can start in
  the earlies stage of a career.

- Ethical : you want to hire developers who care, about their users,
  customers and colleagues.

Although it's great to see evidence of personal projects, remember
that this can be a lot easier for some people than others. People with
a lot of discretionary time can work on personal projects, and attend
meetups and conferences. People with either childcare or eldercare
commitments often can't do this.

Other candidates face tight constraints imposed by
employers. Companies involved in secretq work, for example, although
they have great engineers working for them, are very nervous about
their developers making open source contributions.

- View side projects as "supplementary information" rather than
  "good". If it's there, look at it, and form a more refined view of
  _that one candidate_, but don't make a relative judgement about one
  candidate against another based on personal projects.
* Phone Screens
Phone screens used to be quite the big thing. Technical Interview
Lite, effectively. Like all screening, the idea was always to go
forward with the candidates.

I've used them that way in the past, but always found them stilted and
awkward, and I think candidates did too. It's an odd sort of
conversation, barking questions apropos of nothing into a mouthpiece.

I do them differently now. I use a much more conversational style, and
tend to base questions around a candidate's stated experience. I use
that as a jump-off into some technical discussion. With this approach,
you follow the trail of the discussion.

What I'm looking for is consistency rather than probing for deep
knowledge and experience. For example, if someone has said they do
test-driven development, I'd expect to get some quite confident
discussion around the test framework they're using.

- Use a phone screen as a chance to introduce yourself to each other,
  and to make sure the candidate is on board with the process.

- Focus on what candidates say they know in their CV or cover letter,
  rather than what you need.

- Use a conversational style based around the experience on their
  CV. Follow the trail, and improvise. Get in some technical questions
  that are relevant to the context as the conversation develops.

- It doesn't need to be deep : you're going to have some other, better
  screening mechanism. It's an introduction and a consistency check
  above all.

- Non-sequitur technical questions are just awkward. Good candidates
  experience brain-freeze, and less good candidates will have
  memorised every Google search result for "technical interview phone
  screen questions".

- Keep these to 15-20 minutes. Experienced interviewers tend to know
  quite quickly if a candidate is a go or a no-go, often in the first
  few minutes.

Some people afind this a harder format to run than having a set
question list. You certainly need to think on your feet, but I think
you get a better feel for the candidate.
* Online Technical Test Platorms
Online technical assessment tools like HackerRank and Codility are
becoming more widespread in hiring. I think I understand why companies
are using them, although I think they're used wrongly more often than
not.

These platforms seem to provide an objective measure of capability, to
differentiate. After all, the intent of HackerRank is to Rank your
Hackers, is it not ? I see this all the time in software development,
and not just in hiring - this urge to reduce something complex,
nuanced and difficult to understand down to a dashboard
metric. Numbers are seductive - they promise simple answers and
absolute truths.

In reality, though, these tools are an example of the Streetlight
Effect in action:

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a
> streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his
> keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few
> minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the
> drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman
> asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where
> the light is."

Just because there's light to see by, it doesn't mean you're looking
in the right place. Here's where we really want to look, at the areas
where cost of development, and cost of ownership of code

- Changeability and maintainability of code.

- Clean code and simple design.

- Ability to find a solution by working collaboratively.

- Working in small increments, driven by tests.

- Readability and naming in the code.

Platforms where developers code against a clock is no way of assessing
these important skills and character traits. They assess the
characteristics of _code_, not of people. They're a proxy measure at
best, and not even a particularly useful one.

- If you need to run a coding assessment remotely, look to use the
  excellent CyberDojo instead : a platform that emphasises Test-Driven
  and small steps.

- If algorithmic problem-solving is very important to the sort of work
  you do, there are better ways of running these interviews : more in
  the next post on that.

- Don't sleepwalk into outsourcing your technical interview to an
  online platform. Some aspects of hiring are _just hard work_, and
  you need to be prepared to put in the personal effort with
  candidates for the more challenging parts of your tech selection.

* Coding Assignments

If you need to scale up your technical screening, I propose that this
is a better way of doing it than the online route. It has many benefits

- Relevant

- Tests as well as code

- Style and expressiveness

- Used the tools well - Git especially

- Navigable

* How to run

- Ask candidates to commit regulary

- Ask candidates to narrate how they're doing in the README

- Great springboard for f2f

* Hackathons
* A Balanced View
So now we have a CV, annotated with some notes from a phone
conversation, and a homework assignment that's been reviewed by a
developer.
