* CV, Work Portfolio, Cover Letter 
** Spotting self-actualizing developers
** GitHub and projects are not a candidate's CV
There are some people who can't do this:
- Their companies may have strict IPR assignment clauses that
  discourage them from making open-source contributions
- They may have childcare commitments. This is a weight that falls
  disproportionately on women engineers
- Impostor syndrome is a real thing, especially in early careers. Some
  people won't.
* Phone / Video Screens
** Focus on what candidates know
** Tech questions sans-context are pointless
** Don't duplicate effort if you are doing other screening
** Good to talk people through the process
** A couple of questions around the CV and background is fine
** Example (sorry, it's C++ : I'm very old.)
* Online Technical Tests
Online technical testing tools like Hackerrank and Codility are
becoming more prevalent in hiring. I think I understand why companies
are using them, although I think they're used wrongly more often than
not.

For someone who is involved in the technical hiring process, but isn't
a hands-on developer, these things seem to provide an objective
measure of capability. I see this all the time, the urge to reduce
something complex and hard to understand down to a dashboard.

- How "fast" is a team going

- How much testing do we have measured by coverage

As developers, we know that life isn't as simple as this, and we need
to guide our colleagues to make better decisions.

Most of all, it's a measure of some attributes of an artifact, not of
a person. You're measuring _something about the code_. It's a proxy
measure at best, and not even a particularly good one.

Timing. If you want people to code quickly under pressure, well, I for
one wouldn't want to work for you.

So when should we use them? Use this handy guide to help you decide.

- Algorithms, and algorithmic thinking is really important to
  you. It's core to the work you do and all of the dev roles you have.

- You're hiring on an industrial scale. You have thousands of
  applications.

** Streetlamp Effect
** Superficial Objectivity
** Online screening tools are not your friend
*** A screen, not a substitute for the technical interview
*** Only if you need to : number of roles and applicants
*** Make it relevant to the role
* Coding Assignments
* Hackathons
Talent-spotting, and not really a technical hiring decision.
** Refer back to traits problem in part 1
* Balance
