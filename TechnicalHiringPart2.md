## Why screen candidates

We'd love to see all candidates face to face. We'd love to have a
complete view of their background, character and abilities. In
practice, it's almost impossible for organisations to commit this sort
of time.

More importantly, we don't want to take up the candidate's time if we
think there's a low probability we're going to hire them. They're busy
people too. They're generally in employment, and if they're in Job
Hunt Mode then they'll often have multiple job applications live at
any given time.

Done right, screening gives you and the candidate a way of building
confidence in each other - as your investment in each other grows, so
does your confidence.

I want to emphasise that this needs to be a *matched* investment. At
*every stage*, the candidate needs to feel they know more about you,
in the same way you know more about them. If this investment becomes
unbalanced, then trust is eroded, and however appealing your job ad
was, you're back to sending a signal that this is really just about
your company and its requirements.

## T-Shapes and technical specifics

TODO: diagram

For most of the next two posts, I'm going to have to make some
assumptions. There's an almost infinite variety of technical
backgrounds that might be important to you, and I don't want to be
constantly issuing caveats.

You might have quite exacting requirements - specific experience you
need, or specific tech skills that can't easily be picked up.

So, here's my assumption : if you're hiring experienced developers
with a specific skillset, I'll assume you're smart people, that you
know about the technical domain you're hiring for, and that you can
apply good judgement as to whether the candidate has the right
experience or not. We'll look at the broader picture in these posts.

## CV and cover letter

For each candidate, there's only one question that needs answered at
this stage : "Can I picture this person working as part of our
team?". That's it. I try to blot the rest of the selection process out
of my mind - it's a simple, standalone decision about a single
candidate.

If the anwser is "yes", or "maybe", I'll have a phone conversation. If
the answer is "no", or "it's really unlikely" then the best thing for
the candidate is to give them as much feedback as you can (I'll talk
much more about feedback in the third and final post).

TODO: hard requirement

Putting aside the technical specifics, here are some things I view as
strong positives in a CV, that would make me want to know more about a
candidate:

- Breadth and depth : breadth is a multiplier - people with breadth
  add capability to teams far beyond their core skills. If you're
  hiring developers, look for signs of interest in other disciplines -
  test automation, in product design and broad industry knowledge.

- Self-improvers : evidence of personal or open-source projects is
  great, as well as attendance at any local meetups or conferences. I
  like to see people who are engaged in a wider technical community,
  although I have some important caveats on this later. Initiatives,
  experiments and innovation that people do on the job are things I
  always see as signs of self-improvement too.

- Coaches : I'm reassured when I see some signs that this person helps
  other people, because it gives me a good sense of how someone is
  going to work in a team : coaching, mentoring, helping children or
  adults learn to code, anything. This can start in the earliest
  stages of a career, too, it's not something just for more
  experienced developers. Any signs that people are keen to share
  their knowledge and expertise - at whatever level - are attributes
  to look out for.

- Ethical : you want to hire developers who care - about their users,
  customers, and colleagues. If I see some indications that developers
  are motivated by making things better for people, this makes me
  happy. This could be adoption of better test-driven approaches, more
  secure code to protect users, more efficient code to improve battery
  life on a user's device, improving readability and clarity of code
  for their colleagues.

- Bias for action : it's something of a Silicon Valley term, but it's
  widely applicable in tech as a desirable trait. You want people who
  are going to try things, measure how they work, learn, and
  adapt. Look for evidence that people run spikes, experiments and
  proofs-of-concept, and that they change their approach depending on
  results. Software development is full of uncertainty, but analysis,
  whiteboarding sessions and endless discussions do little to reduce
  the uncertainty. Build, measure, learn.

## Personal projects and meetups : a note of caution

Although it's great to see evidence of personal projects on GitHub or
elsewhere, remember that this can be a lot easier for some people than
others.

It's important to gauge this from a diversity standpoint. People with
a lot of discretionary time can work on personal projects, make open
source contributions, and attend meetups and conferences. However,
people with childcare or eldercare commitments often can't, and these
commitments tend to fall disproportionately on women. Also remember
that some technical communities are far less inclusive than others,
and it would be egregious to penalise women engineers for the
exclusionary behaviour of others.

In those cases where candidates do have these projects and activities,
sure, view them as positives, but always remember that personal
circumstances play a part. And if you're a male manager or developer,
understand that your experience and perception of tech communities and
open source projects could be wildly different from the experience of
women candidates from those same communities.

- Treat personal projects and community involvement as "more
  information about candidate \<x>", and not "this makes candidate
  \<x> a better prospect than candidate \<y>".

## Phone screens

Phone screens used to be quite the big thing: Technical Interview
Lite, effectively. Typically these would be short calls, and you'd be
armed with a set of technical questions. These questions were supposed
to be sure-fire ways of choosing the best candidates to go forward to
the next stage.

I've used them that way in the past, in Q&A mode, but always found
them stilted, awkward and ineffective, and I think candidates did
too. It's a strange sort of conversation, barking questions apropos of
nothing into a mouthpiece. Good candidates blank and stumble over
answers when they don't have context. Other candidates will have
memorised every Google search result for "technical interview phone
screen questions", and wing it, sometimes convincingly.

I still think there are merits to phone, Skype or Hangouts contact
though. It's a chance to check in with the candidate, let them know
there are actual human beings involved on your side of the process,
and that they're regular developers too. They also give the candidate
a chance to ask questions about the company, your technology, culture
and teams. A matched investment.

Although I still value phone screens, I do these very differently
now. I use a much more conversational style, and tend to base
questions around a candidate's *stated* experience rather than a list
of *requirements* for a role. I use that as a jump-off into some
technical discussion.

With this approach, you follow the trail of the discussion, and spot
opportunities to ask some technical questions along the way. It's more
natural, tends to flow better, and you get a more accurate impression
of the candidate to base decisions on. What I'm looking for at this
stage is consistency rather than probing for very deep knowledge and
experience. The knack to this is to make the segue from general
discussion about past experience into more technical discussion as
unforced as possible, using the cues the candidate themselves give
you.

This is certainly a much harder format for the interviewer to run than
having a set question list - for one thing, you need to have good
conversational skills yourself, and you also need to be able to show
the same genuine enthusiasm and interest you're expecting the
candidate to show. It needs you to think on your feet, but I think you
get a better feel for the candidate.

- Use a phone screen as a chance to introduce yourselves to each
  other, and to make sure the candidate is OK with the process.

- Focus on what candidates say they know in their CV or cover letter,
  rather than what you think you need.

- Use a conversational style based around the experience on their
  CV. Follow the trail, and improvise. Get in some technical questions
  that are relevant to the context as the conversation develops.

- Ask a mix of open and closed questions. You want to see how the
  candidate communicates, not just in terms of technical accuracy, but
  whether there's any genuine passion and enthusiasm for the subject.

- It doesn't need to be highly technical : you're going to have some
  other, deeper mechanism. It's an introduction and a consistency
  check above all.

- Non-sequitur technical questions are just awkward. Good candidates
  experience brain-freeze, and others wing it.

- Be wary of hyper-confidence by the candidate. You're looking to hire
  self-aware, reflective people who learn as they go. A career
  presented by the candidate as an unbroken series of ever more
  glorious successes makes me very nervous, because I work in software
  development too and have a decent understanding of what the reality
  looks like. It may be nerves, or it may be something else entirely.

- Keep these around 20 minutes. With practice, you'll develop the
  ability to get a good read on the candidate in this time.

- Do these calls in pairs to give a balanced view. Remember from the
  first post the point about diversity in your pool of interviewers?
  This is a point in the process where diversity of opinion matters,
  and give thought to who should primarily lead the conversation, and
  who should primarily listen.

## Online technical test platforms

Online technical assessment tools like HackerRank and Codility are
becoming more widespread in hiring. I understand why companies are
using them, although I think they're used wrongly - certainly
excessively - more often than not.

TODO: mechanisms and measures

These platforms seem to provide an objective measure of capability, to
differentiate between candidates. After all, the intent of HackerRank
is to Rank your Hackers, is it not? I see this all the time in
software development, and not just in hiring, this urge to reduce
something complex, nuanced and difficult to understand down to a
dashboard metric.

Numbers are seductive - they promise simple answers and absolute
truths. They way these tools tend to be used by organisations, though,
makes them an example of the Streetlight Effect in action [Source -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect):

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a
> streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his
> keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few
> minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the
> drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman
> asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where
> the light is."

Just because there's light to see by, it doesn't mean you're looking
in the right place. These tools measure what can be measured, not
necessarily what's important. Here's where we really want to look, at
the things that have the biggest bearing on whether your code turns
out to be an asset or a liability for your organisation:

- Changeability and maintainability of code.

- Clean code and simple design.

- Ability to find a solution by working collaboratively in pairs, and
  in teams.

- Working in small increments, driven by tests.

- Readability and naming in the code.

Good luck getting an automated tool to assess all of those accurately.

TODO: matched investment

TODO: trajectory

Platforms where developers code against a clock is no way of assessing
these important skills and character traits. They assess the
characteristics of _code_, not of people. They're a proxy measure at
best, and not even a particularly useful one.

And remember that point earlier about matched investment? That the
candidate should learn as much about you as you learn about them?
Well, all they learn with these tools is that you're happy to have a
machine run this part of your recruitment for you.

- If you need to run a coding assessment remotely, look to use the
  excellent CyberDojo instead : a platform that emphasises Test-Driven
  and small steps.

- If timed code challenges are important to you, because you want
  people continually coding quickly to meet arbitrary deadlines, I
  suggest you have other things you need to be thinking about before
  you hire anyone.

- If algorithmic problem-solving is vital to the sort of work you do,
  there are better ways of running algo and data structures interviews
  : more in the next post on that.

- Don't sleepwalk into outsourcing your technical interview to an
  online platform. Some aspects of hiring are _just hard work_, and
  you need to be prepared to put in the personal effort with
  candidates for the more challenging parts of your tech selection.

So who really benefits from online technical test platforms? Let's
take a look at what HackerRank say at the end of their ["Solution
Brief" document](http://hrcdn.net/resources/solutionbrief.pdf):

> Who Benefits From Using Hackerrank?

HackerRank certainly do.

> HackerRank isn’t just about tech recruiters: it’s also about hiring
> managers, interviewers, teammates, and even the candidates
> themselves. For example:

Here we go.

> Recruiters save a ton of time, energy, and money.

Nope. They certainly save energy, but hiring the wrong people (or
constantly hiring exactly the same *sort* of people...), doesn't save
anything, in fact it costs organisations very badly over the long
term.

This is easily the most short-sighted statement they make, but I think
it's also the most telling.

> Hiring Managers can hire based on programming skills instead of
> relying on resumes and white boards.

Translation : Some managers aren't particularly technical, and would
prefer to be presented with a simplistic ranking from which they will
choose - obviously! - the candidate with the "best" number. This
decision will be made devoid of any context or sense of the
candidate's potential, character, background, journey or aspirations.

But then - to this type of manager - all that matters is "skill",
because all they are is "programmers" and all they will be doing is
"programming". And of course you want to buy the most efficient and
cost-effective units of production rather than creative, chaotic,
collaborative, messy human beings with actual ideas, who can
contribute to your products and organisation in ways you never even
imagined possible.

> Teammates help ensure talented, qualified candidates join their
> team.

What it will ensure is that these "teammates" are working next to
people exactly like them in every respect.

> Candidates consider it a fun, engaging way to interview and allows
> anyone, from anywhere, to prove they are qualified

No candidate ever has described a timed, online coding challenge in
the context of a job application as "fun", or "engaging".

## Coding assignments

If you need to scale up your technical screening, I propose that this
is a better way of doing it than the online route. It has many
benefits

## "Aptitude" tests

Some organisations do psychometric evaluations or "aptitude
testing". These are numerical, inductive, and verbal reasoning tests,
and - spoiler alert - are absolutely nothing to do with real-world
aptitude in software development.

I've no idea why organisations do these, and I strongly suspect they
don't either. If someone can show from their experience that they've
work as part of a team in delivering solutions to complex problems,
and their screening and technical interview shows they can write good
code, I'd say their grey matter is working pretty well for them.

Hard pass.
