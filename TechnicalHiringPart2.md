* Why Screen
We'd love to see all candidates face to face. We'd love to have a
complete view of their skills, background and abilities. In practice,
it's almost impossible for organisations to commit this sort of time.

Just as importantly, we also don't want to take up the candidate's
time if we think there'a low probability we're going to hire
them. They're busy people too. They're generally in employment, and if
they're in Job Hunt Mode then they'll often have multiple job
applications live at any given time.

Screening gives you and the candidate a way of building confidence in
each other - as your investment in each other grows, so does your
confidence.

So goes the theory.

I want to emphasise that this needs to be a *matched* investment. At
each stage, the candidate needs to feel they know more about you, in
the same way you know more about them. If this becomes unbalanced,
trust is eroded.
* T-Shapes and Technical Specifics
For most of the next two posts, I'm going to have to make some
assumptions. There's an almost infinite variety of technical
backgrounds that might be important to you, and I don't want to be
constantly caveating.

You might have quite exacting requirements - specific experience you
need, or specific tech skills that can't easily be picked up.

So, here's my assumption : if you're hiring for a specific or niche
skillset, I'll assume you're smart people who you know about the
technical domain you're hiring for, and you can apply good judgement
as to whether the candidate has it or not. We'll look at the broader
picture in these posts.

* CV and Cover Letter
So you have a CV. Probably a whole bunch. Perhaps covering letters,
possibly some links to a portfolio of work for some candidates.

For each candidate, there's only question that needs answering at this
stage : "Can we picture this person working as part of our team?"

At this stage, I'm trying to decide whether you want to have a
conversation with the person - that's all, just a conversation. A
phone screen takes about 15-20 minutes, so I'm not going to spend 30
minutes agonising over that decision.

Putting aside the technical specifics, here are some things I view as
positives in a CV, that might make me want to have a conversation with
them. These are mine.

- Breadth and Depth

- Curiosity 

- A self-improver : Evidence of personal or open-source projects is
  great, as well as attendance at any local meetups or conferences. I
  like to see people who are engaged in a wider technical community (I
  have some caveats on this later though).

- A coach : I'm reassured when I see some signs that this person helps
  other people : coaching, mentoring, helping kids or adults learn to
  code. This can start in the earliest stages of a career, too, it's
  not something that's exclusively for more experienced developers.

- Ethical : you want to hire developers who care, about their users,
  customers and colleagues.

Although it's great to see evidence of personal projects, remember
that this can be a lot easier for some people than others - and you
need to think hard about diversity factors here too. People with a lot
of discretionary time can work on personal projects, and attend
meetups and conferences. People with childcare or eldercare
commitments often can't. These commitments tend to fall
disproportionately on women. Also remember that some technical
communities are less inclusive than others, and it would be wrong to
penalise someone for other people's exclusionary behaviour.

Where candidates do have these projects and activities, sure, view
them as positives, but always remember that personal circumstances
play a part.

** Don't agonise
** Requirements and flexibility
** Signs and signals
** Review objectively
** But trust your gut too
** Resist the rank


** Summary
- View side projects as "supplementary information" rather than
  "good". If it's there, look at it, and form a more refined view of
  _that one candidate_, but don't make a relative judgement about one
  candidate against another based on personal projects.
* Phone Screens
Phone screens used to be quite the big thing. Technical Interview
Lite, effectively. Like all screening, the idea was always to go
forward with the candidates.

I've used them that way in the past in Q&A mode, but always found them
stilted, awkward and ineffective, and I think candidates did too. It's
a strange sort of conversation, barking questions apropos of nothing
into a mouthpiece.

I do them differently now. I use a much more conversational style, and
tend to base questions around a candidate's stated experience rather
than a list of requirements for a role. I use that as a jump-off into
some technical discussion. With this approach, you follow the trail of
the discussion, and spot opportunities to ask some technical questions
along the way. It's more natural, tends to flow better, and you get a
more accurate impression of the candidate to base decisions on.

What I'm looking for at this stage is consistency rather than probing
for deep knowledge and experience. For example, if someone has said
they do test-driven development, I'd expect to get some quite
confident discussion around the test framework they're using. I'd
expect them to have some examples from their work that they can talk
about.

I'll usually ask a mix of open and closed questions. I want to see how
the candidate communicates - and not just in terms of technical
accuracy, but whether there's any genuine passion and enthusiasm for
the subject.

- Use a phone screen as a chance to introduce yourself to each other,
  and to make sure the candidate is on board with the process.

- Focus on what candidates say they know in their CV or cover letter,
  rather than what you need.

- Use a conversational style based around the experience on their
  CV. Follow the trail, and improvise. Get in some technical questions
  that are relevant to the context as the conversation develops.

- It doesn't need to be deep : you're going to have some other, better
  screening mechanism. It's an introduction and a consistency check
  above all.

- Non-sequitur technical questions are just awkward. Good candidates
  experience brain-freeze, and less good candidates will have
  memorised every Google search result for "technical interview phone
  screen questions".

- Keep these to 15-20 minutes. Experienced interviewers tend to know
  quite quickly if a candidate is a go or a no-go, often in the first
  few minutes.

Some people afind this a harder format to run than having a set
question list. You certainly need to think on your feet, but I think
you get a better feel for the candidate.
* Online Technical Test Platorms
Online technical assessment tools like HackerRank and Codility are
becoming more widespread in hiring. I think I understand why companies
are using them, although I think they're used wrongly (or excessively)
more often than not.

TODO: mechanisms and measures

TODO: investment from candidate

These platforms seem to provide an objective measure of capability, to
differentiate. After all, the intent of HackerRank is to Rank your
Hackers, is it not ? I see this all the time in software development,
and not just in hiring - this urge to reduce something complex,
nuanced and difficult to understand down to a dashboard
metric. Numbers are seductive - they promise simple answers and
absolute truths.

In reality, though, these tools are an example of the Streetlight
Effect in action:

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a
> streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his
> keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few
> minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the
> drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman
> asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where
> the light is."

Just because there's light to see by, it doesn't mean you're looking
<<<<<<< HEAD
in the right place. HackerRank and Codility measure that which can be
measured, not necessarily what's important.

More fundamentally - and a thought that seems to occur to virtually
no-one who uses these tools - 

Here's where we really want to look:
in the right place. Here's where we really want to look, at the areas
where cost of development, and cost of ownership of code

- Changeability and maintainability of code.

- Clean code and simple design.

- Ability to find a solution by working collaboratively in pairs, and
  in teams.

- Working in small increments, driven by tests.

- Readability and naming in the code.

TODO: "it's just a screen". Refer back to first post.

Platforms where developers code against a clock is no way of assessing
these important skills and character traits. They assess the
characteristics of _code_, not of people. They're a proxy measure at
best, and not even a particularly useful one.

- If timed code challenges are important to you, because you want
  people continually "delivering against tight deadlines", you're
  probably horrible people. Think about the signal this is sending.

- If you need to run a coding assessment remotely, look to use the
  excellent CyberDojo instead : a platform that emphasises Test-Driven
  and small steps.

- If algorithmic problem-solving is vital to the sort of work you do,
  there are better ways of running algo and data structures interviews
  : more in the next post on that.

- Don't sleepwalk into outsourcing your technical interview to an
  online platform. Some aspects of hiring are _just hard work_, and
  you need to be prepared to put in the personal effort with
  candidates for the more challenging parts of your tech selection.

* Coding Assignments

If you need to scale up your technical screening, I propose that this
is a better way of doing it than the online route. It has many
benefits

- Relevant

- Tests as well as code

- Style and expressiveness

- Used the tools well - Git especially

- Navigable

* How to run

- Set up a GitHub repository and ask your candidates to fork the
  repostitory.

- Ask candidates to commit regulary

- Ask candidates to narrate how they're doing in the README

- Great springboard for f2f

- Be clear about your own coding values

- Submit via a pull request (the pull will never be merged)

* A Modified Pipeline
