* Why screen candidates
We'd love to see all candidates face to face. We'd love to have a
complete view of their skills, background and abilities. In practice,
it's almost impossible for organisations to commit this sort of time.

More importantly, we don't want to take up the candidate's time if we
think there's a low probability we're going to hire them. They're busy
people too. They're generally in employment, and if they're in Job
Hunt Mode then they'll often have multiple job applications live at
any given time.

Done right, screening gives you and the candidate a way of building
confidence in each other - as your investment in each other grows, so
does your confidence.

I want to emphasise that this needs to be a *matched* investment. At
*every stage*, the candidate needs to feel they know more about you,
in the same way you know more about them. If this becomes unbalanced,
then trust is eroded, and however appealing your job ad was, you're
back to sending a signal that this is really just about your company
and its requirements.
* T-Shapes and Technical Specifics
For most of the next two posts, I'm going to have to make some
assumptions. There's an almost infinite variety of technical
backgrounds that might be important to you, and I don't want to be
constantly caveating.

You might have quite exacting requirements - specific experience you
need, or specific tech skills that can't easily be picked up.

So, here's my assumption : if you're hiring experienced developers for
a specific skillset, I'll assume you're smart people, that you know
about the technical domain you're hiring for, and that you can apply
good judgement as to whether the candidate has the right experience or
not. We'll look at the broader picture in these posts.
* CV and Cover Letter
So you have a CV. Perhaps and covering letters, possibly some links to
a portfolio of work for some candidates. Most likely, you'll 

For each candidate, there's only one question that needs answering at
this stage : "Can I picture this person working as part of our
team?". That's it. I try to blot the rest of the process out of my
mind, and don't agonise.

At this stage, I'm trying to decide whether I want to have a further
conversation with the person. As an example, a phone screen can take
about 15-20 minutes, so if you spend 30 minutes agonising over this
decision, you're doing it wrong.

Putting aside the technical specifics, here are some things I view as
positives in a CV, things I view as strongly positive that would make
me want to know more about a candidate:

- Breadth and depth : breadth is a multiplier - people with breadth
  add capability to teams far beyond their core skills. If you're
  hiring developers, look for signs of interest in test automation, in
  product design and broad industry knowledge.

- Self-improvers : Evidence of personal or open-source projects is
  great, as well as attendance at any local meetups or conferences. I
  like to see people who are engaged in a wider technical community
  (although I have some caveats on this later). Initiatives,
  experiments and innovation that people do on the job are things I
  always see as signs of self-improvement too.

- Coaches : I'm reassured when I see some signs that this person helps
  other people, because it gives me a good sense of how someone is
  going to work in a team : coaching, mentoring, helping children or
  adults learn to code, anything. This can start in the earliest
  stages of a career, too, it's not something just for more
  experienced developers. Any signs that people are keen to share
  their knowledge and expertise - at whatever level - are attributes
  to look out for.

- Ethical : you want to hire developers who care - about their users,
  customers, and colleagues. If I see some indications that developers
  are motivated by making things better for people, this makes me
  happy. This could be adoption of better test-driven approaches, more
  secure code to protect users, more efficient code to improve battery
  life on a user's device, improving readability and clarity of code
  for their colleagues.

- Bias for action : it's something of a Silicon Valley term, but it's
  widely applicable in tech as a desirable trait. You want people who
  are going to try things, measure how they work, learn, and
  adapt. Look for evidence that people run spikes, experiments and
  proofs-of-concept, and that they change their approach depending on
  results. Software development is full of uncertainty, but analysis,
  whiteboarding sessions and endless discussions do little to reduce
  the uncertainty. Build, measure, learn [footnote].

** Personal projects and meetups : a note of caution

Although it's great to see evidence of personal projects on GitHub or
elsewhere, remember that this can be a lot easier for some people than
others.

Consider diversity here. People with a lot of discretionary time can
work on personal projects, make open source contributions, and attend
meetups and conferences. However, people with childcare or eldercare
commitments often can't, and these commitments tend to fall
disproportionately on women. Also remember that some technical
communities are far less inclusive than others, and it would be
egregious to penalise women engineers for the exclusionary behaviour
of others.

In those cases where candidates do have these projects and activities,
sure, view them as positives, but always remember that personal
circumstances play a part. And if you're a male manager or developer,
understand that your experience and perception of tech communities and
open source projects could be wildly different from the experience of
women, transgender and non-binary candidates from those same
communities.

- Treat personal projects and community involvement as "more
  information about candidate <x>", and not "this makes candidate <x>
  a better prospect than candidate <y>".

* Phone Screens
Phone screens used to be quite the big thing. Technical Interview
Lite, effectively.

I've used them that way in the past in Q&A mode, but always found them
stilted, awkward and ineffective, and I think candidates did too. It's
a strange sort of conversation, barking questions apropos of nothing
into a mouthpiece.

I do them differently now. I use a much more conversational style, and
tend to base questions around a candidate's stated experience rather
than a list of requirements for a role. I use that as a jump-off into
some technical discussion. With this approach, you follow the trail of
the discussion, and spot opportunities to ask some technical questions
along the way. It's more natural, tends to flow better, and you get a
more accurate impression of the candidate to base decisions on.

What I'm looking for at this stage is consistency rather than probing
for deep knowledge and experience. For example, if someone has said
they do test-driven development, I'd expect to get some quite
confident discussion around the test framework they're using. I'd
expect them to have some examples from their work that they can talk
about.

I'll usually ask a mix of open and closed questions. I want to see how
the candidate communicates - and not just in terms of technical
accuracy, but whether there's any genuine passion and enthusiasm for
the subject.

- Use a phone screen as a chance to introduce yourself to each other,
  and to make sure the candidate is OK with the process.

- Focus on what candidates say they know in their CV or cover letter,
  rather than what you need.

- Use a conversational style based around the experience on their
  CV. Follow the trail, and improvise. Get in some technical questions
  that are relevant to the context as the conversation develops.

- It doesn't need to be deep : you're going to have some other, better
  screening mechanism. It's an introduction and a consistency check
  above all.

- Non-sequitur technical questions are just awkward. Good candidates
  experience brain-freeze, and less strong candidates will have
  memorised every Google search result for "technical interview phone
  screen questions".

- Keep these to 15-20 minutes. Experienced interviewers tend to know
  quite quickly if a candidate is a fit, often in the first few
  minutes.

Some people afind this a harder format to run than having a set
question list. You certainly need to think on your feet, but I think
you get a better feel for the candidate.
* Online Technical Test Platorms
Online technical assessment tools like HackerRank and Codility are
becoming more widespread in hiring. I think I understand why companies
are using them, although I think they're used wrongly - certainly
excessively - more often than not.

TODO: mechanisms and measures

These platforms seem to provide an objective measure of capability, to
differentiate. After all, the intent of HackerRank is to Rank your
Hackers, is it not ? I see this all the time in software development,
and not just in hiring - this urge to reduce something complex,
nuanced and difficult to understand down to a dashboard
metric. Numbers are seductive - they promise simple answers and
absolute truths.

In reality, though, these tools are an example of the Streetlight
Effect in action:

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a
> streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his
> keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few
> minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the
> drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman
> asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where
> the light is."

Just because there's light to see by, it doesn't mean you're looking
in the right place. These tools measure what can be measured, not
necessarily what's important.

Here's where we really want to look, at the things that have the
biggest bearing on the cost of development, and the cost of ownership
of code:

- Changeability and maintainability of code.

- Clean code and simple design.

- Ability to find a solution by working collaboratively in pairs, and
  in teams.

- Working in small increments, driven by tests.

- Readability and naming in the code.

TODO: "it's just a screen". Refer back to first post.

Platforms where developers code against a clock is no way of assessing
these important skills and character traits. They assess the
characteristics of _code_, not of people. They're a proxy measure at
best, and not even a particularly useful one.

And remember that point earlier about matched investment? That the
candidate should learn as much about you as you learn about them?
Well, all they learn with these tools is that you're happy to have a
machine run this part of your recruitment for you.

- If you need to run a coding assessment remotely, look to use the
  excellent CyberDojo instead : a platform that emphasises Test-Driven
  and small steps.

- If timed code challenges are important to you, because you want
  people continually coding quickly to meet arbitrary deadlines, I
  suggest you have other things you need to be thinking about before
  you hire anyone.

- If algorithmic problem-solving is vital to the sort of work you do,
  there are better ways of running algo and data structures interviews
  : more in the next post on that.

- Don't sleepwalk into outsourcing your technical interview to an
  online platform. Some aspects of hiring are _just hard work_, and
  you need to be prepared to put in the personal effort with
  candidates for the more challenging parts of your tech selection.

* Coding Assignments
If you need to scale up your technical screening, I propose that this
is a better way of doing it than the online route. It has many
benefits

- Relevant

- Communication

- Tests as well as code

- Style and expressiveness

- Used the tools well - Git especially

- Navigable

* How to run
- Set up a GitHub repository and ask your candidates to fork the
  repostitory.

- Ask candidates to commit regulary

- Ask candidates to narrate how they're doing in the README

- Great springboard for f2f

- Be clear about your own coding values

- Submit via a pull request (the pull will never be merged)

* A Modified Pipeline
* Other things
I don't know why companies do this. I'm hiring developers, not
recreating MENSA.
