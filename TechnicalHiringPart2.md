* CV, Work Portfolio, Cover Letter
I think the

What they say they can do : CV, cover letter
What they show they can do : technical interviews
What they actually do : how it all translates into 

So we're on Step 1 here : we have a CV and cover letter, and it's
mostly words. OK, sometimes a picture. Yes, yes, sometimes links to
portfolio work. But mostly words.

Here's a thing about words: some people are good with them, others not
so good.

Things I look for:

Things I take as negatives

** Spotting self-actualizing developers
** GitHub and projects are not a candidate's CV
There are some people who can't do this:
- Their companies may have strict IPR assignment clauses that
  discourage them from making open-source contributions
- They may have childcare commitments. This is a weight that falls
  disproportionately on women engineers.
- Impostor syndrome is a real thing, especially in early careers. Some
  people won't.

That said, filter this guy out for sure. Who'd choose a GitHub
username like that? Chancer.
* Phone / Video Screens
They used to be a big thing, phone screens. Technical Interview Lite,
effectively. Like all screening, the idea was always to go forward
with the candidates. You'd have a list of "dead cert" questions, that

I've used them that way in the past, but always found them stilted and
awkward, and I think candidates did too. It's an odd sort of
conversation, barking questions apropos of nothing into a mouthpiece.

I do them differently now. I use a much more conversational style, and
tend to base questions around a candidate's stated experience. I use
that as a jump-off into some technical discussion. With this approach,
you follow the trail of the discussion.

What I'm looking for is consistency rather than probing for deep
knowledge and experience. For example, if someone has said they do
test-driven development, I'd expect to get some quite confident
discussion around the test framework they're using.

I'll often ask quite open questions, because I find them. "Oh, tell me
how you found that". I want to see how the candidate communicates -
and not just in terms of technical accuracy, but whether there's any
genuine enthusiasm for the subject.

Some people - maybe not strong on the conversational skills - find
this a harder format to run than having set question list. You have to
think on your feet, certainly, but I think you get a better feel for
the candidate.

- Use a phone screen as a chance to introduce yourself to each other,
  and to make sure the candidate is on board with the process.

- Focus on what candidates say they know, rather than what you
  need. Remember : trajectory.

- Use a conversational style based around the experience on their
  CV. Follow the trail, and improvise. Get in some technical questions
  that are relevant to the context.

- It doesn't need to be deep : you're going to have some other, better
  screening mechanism. It's an introduction and a consistency check
  above all.

- Non-sequitur technical questions are just awkward. Good candidates
  experience brain-freeze, and less good candidates will have
  memorised every Google search result for "technical interview phone
  screen questions".

- Keep these to 15-20 minutes. Experienced interviewers tend to know
  quite quickly, often in the first few minutes.

* Online Technical Tests
Online technical testing tools like HackerRank and Codility are
becoming more prevalent in hiring. I think I understand why companies
are using them, although I think they're used wrongly more often than
not.

For someone who is involved in the technical hiring process, but isn't
themselves a hands-on developer, these things seem to provide an
objective measure of capability. The intent of HackerRank is to Rank
your Hackers, is it not?

I see this all the time, the urge to reduce something complex, nuanced
and hard to understand down to a dashboard metric.

- How "fast" is a team going. Slackers.

- How much developer testing is happening : measure code coverage, and
  chide a team that has 93% coverage because another team has 94%
  (spoiler: not necessarily, there are good tests and bad tests).

Numbers are seductive : a siren song of simple answers, absolute
truths and, measurable differentiation. In reality, though, these
tools are an example of the Streetlight Effect in action:

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a
> streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his
> keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few
> minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the
> drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman
> asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where
> the light is."

Just because there's light to see by, it doesn't mean you're looking
in the right place.

It's a measure of some attributes of an artifact, not of a
person. You're measuring _something about the code_. It's a proxy
measure at best, and not a particularly good one.

- The elusive property of changeability of code - being able to keep
  the code in a state where it's resilient in the face of change.
- How our candidate works collaboratively to reach a
  solution. Nothing.
- Using agile development, baby steps in. Nothing. In fact, you can't
  even write tests in any standard unit test framework.
- Readability and naming in the code ?  Nothing. 

No, if you need to do online code tests, pair using the excellent
CyberDojo instead.

Timing / beat the clock. If having developers code quickly under
pressure is so important to you that you give it such a prominent part
of , you're probably horrible people, and I for one wouldn't want to
work for you.

In time, I think these tools will go the same way as the annual
performance review : something that had its moment. A good idea at the
time, maybe, but we've found a better way now and don't need it
anymore.

You should worry also about the message these tools send to
candidates. At some point, each person applying for a role with your
company has pictured themselves working there. They may know people
who work there already. They're bought into your ethos,

We should be more human.

So when should we use them? Use this handy reference guide to help you
decide:

- Never.

* Coding Assignments
If you need to scale up your technical screening, I propose that this
is a better way of doing it than the online route.
** Benefits
- Relevant
- Tests as well as code
- Style and expressiveness
- Used the tools well - Git especially
- Navigable
** How to run:
- Ask candidates to commit regulary
- Ask candidates to narrate how they're doing in the README
- Great springboard for f2f
** Paid assignments
- Infeasible
- Unfair

* Hackathons
I know a lot of companies use these as a talent-spotting mechanism,
especially for early careers. They're fun, and largely harmless.
** Refer back to traits problem in part 1
* Balance
So now we have a CV, annotated with some notes from a phone
conversation, and a homework assignment that's been reviewed by a
developer.
