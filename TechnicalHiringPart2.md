* CV, Work Portfolio, Cover Letter
** Spotting self-actualizing developers
** GitHub and projects are not a candidate's CV
There are some people who can't do this:
- Their companies may have strict IPR assignment clauses that
  discourage them from making open-source contributions
- They may have childcare commitments. This is a weight that falls
  disproportionately on women engineers.
- Impostor syndrome is a real thing, especially in early careers. Some
  people won't.

That said, filter this guy out for sure. Who'd choose a GitHub
username like that? Chancer.
* Phone / Video Screens
** Focus on what candidates know
** Tech questions sans-context are pointless
** Don't duplicate effort if you are doing other screening
** Good to talk people through the process
** A couple of questions around the CV and background is fine
** Example (sorry, it's C++ : I'm very old.)
* Online Technical Tests
Online technical testing tools like HackerRank and Codility are
becoming more prevalent in hiring. I think I understand why companies
are using them, although I think they're used wrongly more often than
not.

For someone who is involved in the technical hiring process, but isn't
themselves a hands-on developer, these things seem to provide an
objective measure of capability. I see this all the time, the urge to
reduce something complex and hard to understand down to a dashboard.

- How "fast" is a team going

- How much testing do we have measured by coverage

As developers, we know that life isn't as simple as this, and we need
to guide our colleagues to make better decisions.

What's the first thing I look for developers to do? Write a test. Try
that in HackerRank and see how far you get.

If you need to do online code tests, pair using the excellent
CyberDojo instead.

Most of all, it's a measure of some attributes of an artifact, not of
a person. You're measuring _something about the code_. It's a proxy
measure at best, and not even a particularly good one.

Timing / beat the clock. If having developers code quickly under
pressure is so important to you that you give it such a prominent part
of , you're probably horrible people, and I for one wouldn't want to
work for you.

In time, I think these tools will go the same way as the annual
performance review : something that had its moment. A good idea at the
time, maybe, but we've found a better way.

TODO : message to candidates.

So when should we use them? Use this handy guide to help you decide:

- Algorithms, and algorithmic thinking is really important to
  you. It's core to the work you do and all of the dev roles you have.

- You're hiring on an industrial scale. You have thousands of
  applications.

** Streetlamp Effect
** Superficial Objectivit
* Coding Assignments
If you need to scale up your technical screening, I propose that this
is a better way of doing it than the online route.
** Benefits
- Relevant
- Tests as well as code
- Style and expressiveness
- Used the tools well - Git especially
- Navigable
** How to run:
- Ask candidates to commit regulary
- Ask candidates to narrate how they're doing in the README
- Great springboard for f2f
** Paid assignments
- Infeasible
- Unfair
* Hackathons
I know a lot of companies use these as a talent-spotting mechanism,
especially for early careers. They're fun, and largely harmless.
** Refer back to traits problem in part 1
* Balance
So now we have a CV, annotated with some notes from a phone
conversation, and a homework assignment that's been reviewed by a
developer.
