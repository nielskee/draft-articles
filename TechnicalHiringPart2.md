## CV and Cover Letter

I always think there are three separate aspects of a candidate.

- What they _say_ they can do : CV, cover letter

- What they _show_ they can do : technical interviews

- What they _actually_ do : how it all translates into real
  development work on your codebase.

You can test the first two, and you can predict the third. We're
on Step 1 here : we have a CV, a cover letter, possible some links to
portfolio work.

At this stage, I'm trying to decide whether I want to have a
conversation with the person. A phone screen takes about 15-20
minutes, so I'm not going to spend 30 minutes agonising over that
decision.

Your might have quite exacting requirements - specific experience you
need, or specific tech skills that can't easily be picked up. You
might be hiring someone specifically to help you bootstrap you into a
new technology.  Whatever the situation, you're going to know in about
5 minutes with a CV and cover letter whether you're looking at a
viable candidate or not.

Putting aside your tech specifics, here are some things I view as
positives in a CV, that might make me want to have a conversation with
them.

- Self-improver

- Breadth

- Evidence of personal or open-source projects, attendance at meetups
  and conferences, and engaged in their community.

- Some signs that they help other people : coaching, mentoring,
  helping kids or adults learn to code.

Although it's great to see evidence of personal projects, remember
that this can be a lot easier for some people than others. People with
a lot of discretionary time can work on personal projects, and attend
meetups and conferences. People with either childcare or eldercare
commitments often can't.

Where candidates do have these projects and activities, sure, view
them as positives, but always remember that personal circumstances
play a part.

## Phone / Video Screens

They used to be a big thing, phone screens. Technical Interview Lite,
effectively. Like all screening, the idea was always to go forward
with the candidates. You'd have a list of "dead cert" questions, that

I've used them that way in the past, but always found them stilted and
awkward, and I think candidates did too. It's an odd sort of
conversation, barking questions apropos of nothing into a mouthpiece.

I do them differently now. I use a much more conversational style, and
tend to base questions around a candidate's stated experience. I use
that as a jump-off into some technical discussion. With this approach,
you follow the trail of the discussion.

What I'm looking for is consistency rather than probing for deep
knowledge and experience. For example, if someone has said they do
test-driven development, I'd expect to get some quite confident
discussion around the test framework they're using.

I'll often ask quite open questions, because I find them. "Oh, tell me
how you found that". I want to see how the candidate communicates -
and not just in terms of technical accuracy, but whether there's any
genuine enthusiasm for the subject.

- Use a phone screen as a chance to introduce yourself to each other,
  and to make sure the candidate is on board with the process.

- Focus on what candidates say they know, rather than what you
  need. Remember : trajectory.

- Use a conversational style based around the experience on their
  CV. Follow the trail, and improvise. Get in some technical questions
  that are relevant to the context as the conversation develops.

- It doesn't need to be deep : you're going to have some other, better
  screening mechanism. It's an introduction and a consistency check
  above all.

- Non-sequitur technical questions are just awkward. Good candidates
  experience brain-freeze, and less good candidates will have
  memorised every Google search result for "technical interview phone
  screen questions".

- Keep these to 15-20 minutes. Experienced interviewers tend to know
  quite quickly if a candidate is a go or a no-go, often in the first
  few minutes.

Some people afind this a harder format to run than having a set
question list. You certainly need to think on your feet, but I think
you get a better feel for the candidate.

## Online Technical Test Platorms

Online technical assessment tools like HackerRank and Codility are
becoming more widespread in hiring. I think I understand why companies
are using them, although I think they're used wrongly more often than
not.

These platforms seem to provide an objective measure of
capability. The intent of HackerRank is to Rank your Hackers, is it
not ? I see this all the time in software development, and not just in
hiring - this urge to reduce something complex, nuanced and difficult
to understand down to a dashboard metric. Numbers are seductive - they
promise simple answers and absolute truths.

In reality, though, these tools are an example of the Streetlight
Effect in action:

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a
> streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his
> keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few
> minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the
> drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman
> asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where
> the light is."

Just because there's light to see by, it doesn't mean you're looking
in the right place. Here's where we want to look:

- Changeability and maintainability of code.

- Clean code and simple design.

- Ability to find a solution by working collaboratively.

- Working in small increments, driven by tests.

- Readability and naming in the code.

Platforms where developers code against a clock is no way of assessing
these important skills.  In time, I think these platforms will go the
same way as the annual performance review. Something that had its
moment. A good idea at the time, maybe, but we've found a better way
now and don't need it anymore.

- If you need to run a coding assessment remotely, look to use the
  excellent CyberDojo instead : a platform that emphasises Test-Driven
  and small steps.

- If algorithmic problem-solving is very important to the sort of work
  you do, there are better ways of running these interviews : more in
  the next post on that.

- Don't sleepwalk into outsourcing your technical interview to an
  online platform. Some aspects of hiring are just _hard_, and you
  need to be prepared to put in the personal effort with candidates
  for the more challenging parts of your tech selection.

## Coding Assignments

If you need to scale up your technical screening, I propose that this
is a better way of doing it than the online route. It has many benefits

- Relevant

- Tests as well as code

- Style and expressiveness

- Used the tools well - Git especially

- Navigable

## How to run

- Ask candidates to commit regulary

- Ask candidates to narrate how they're doing in the README

- Great springboard for f2f

## Hackathons

I know a lot of companies use these as a talent-spotting mechanism,
especially for early careers. They're fun, and largely harmless.

## Balance

So now we have a CV, annotated with some notes from a phone
conversation, and a homework assignment that's been reviewed by a
developer.
