# Technical Hiring

## Background

I do talks and workshops on software development careers and tech
hiring for students at universities, colleges and code academies. It's
occurred to me recently that I'm very tardy in having those same
conversations with employers. Technical interviewing is an acquired
skill, but it's something that's often left to chance in
organisations.

This 3-part post aims to give some advice to individuals and companies
who are involved in hiring developers. It's not exhaustive, but
hopefully you'll take away some ideas you can apply in your own
organisation.

I'm going to nail my colours to the mast here : I'm a techy, and this
is written from the perspective of a developer (and occasional
technical manager...) interviewing and hiring other developers, not an
HR, talent or recruitment perspective. I hope and expect that there's
a significant overlap between these perspectives, though.

Let's warm up with a lively jog around some of the essential concepts
that we'll build on in the next couple of posts.

## Hire For Trajectory

There's a quote by Kevlin Henney that appeared in a preface to Pete
Goodliffe's book "Becoming a Better Programmer"
<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>. I often share this quote in talks, because it
captures perfectly what I'm looking for when I'm building teams:

> "[...] In the long term, what matters is less where on the
distribution someone is than where they are headed. If you want to
divide programmers into two groups, there are programmers who get
better and programmers who don't. You care about the first group."

What you're seeing when you run technical interviews is a snapshot of
someone's abilities and knowledge, frozen at a point in time. But
where did they start, how far have they come, and where are they
headed?

The challenge in technical hiring is to spot these self-actualising,
self-improving developers that Kevlin talks about, not just by looking
at what they can do, but by looking at their journey, their attitude,
the signs that they have improved, and continue to improve. We'll talk
more about this in later posts.

- Hire people for where they're going to be, not for where they are
  now.

## Hire For Diversity

I've worked in software development for 30 years. I've seen some
progress over that time, but the pace is still painfully slow. On
gender diversity, we have a long way to go. We all have a
responsibility to fix the situation in tech for fundamental reasons of
equality, quite apart from the benefits that diverse teams bring.

But benefits there most certainly are. Diverse teams are *good*
teams. Any developer will tell you about the value of a different
mindset and a different perspective when solving problems.

To help counter unconscious bias in hiring, use the existing diversity
in your team help you get to the next level. Get as diverse a pool of
technical interviewers involved in your hiring process as you can, and
give them a *real voice* in the hiring decision, not just tagging
along for the ride.

Actively coach people in your team in technical interviewing - it's a
skill like any other, and it needs practice. If it remains something
that senior managers do, you're not going to make progress.

Some interview styles favour male candidates, in particular those
candidates who are confident, assertive and sell themselves
effectively. Bragging isn't a uniquely male trait, but it's certainly
more prevalent. If you structure your technical hiring around these
formats, and factor in the unconscious bias that favours "ambitious"
candidates, you've got a toxic combination on your hands.

In some of the interview styles we're going to look at, there are
positive benefits for diverse hiring. We'll favour approaches that
focus on collaborative traits, and give a more holistic view of how
someone would fare in a team setting.

- Make diversity in your tech hiring an explicit goal, not an
  afterthought.

- Use interviewing approaches that favour collaborative
  problem-solving, rather than just giving a stage for confident and
  assertive candidates to be confident and assertive.

- Don't use "ninja developer" and "rockstar developer" cliches : this
  is a gung-ho vocabulary that exacerbates bias. Also, developers will
  laugh at you behind your back.

- Mitigate the effects of unconscious bias by having diversity in your
  pool of technical interviewers.

- Coach everyone in your team on technical interviewing, and give them
  practice. It's difficult to get right.

## Hire Across The Experience Range

It's a tough, competitive market to be hiring in. I see companies
looking to fill the same roles month after month. The pool of highly
experienced developers is finite, and none of them are sitting on the
bench waiting for your call.

Accept that you're going to hire less experienced people, and be
prepared to invest in them. Actually, scratch that - don't accept it,
*celebrate it*. Helping out the next generation of developers is a
great thing - for your company, for your experienced developers who
get to mentor them, and of course for those next-generation developers
too.

Start looking into apprenticeships, coding academies, and new graduate
entrants. I've seen new graduate entrants to development roles make
astounding progress over 1-2 years from a standing start, given the
right access to technical mentors.

As you do this, I recommend you take a good, hard look at your
organisation and culture, and think about what you need to do to make
it a supportive learning environment for teams with mixed levels of
experience.

The best support for learning and sharing is through [Communities Of
Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice). This
is a self-organising model that lets groups of people working in the
same field to share experience, support their colleagues, learn new
things, and to form a view on what approaches work for their field or
technology<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>. Again, trust them, don't manage them.

You need to make it clear that you support a culture of learning in
your organisation, and that you encourage informal learning, pairing
and mentoring. Make sure you also support it with more than just words
by building learning time into the working week.

None of these things need to be part of a formal performance process,
and none of them need any kind of coordination by a central learning
team. They should happen spontaneously, continuously and organically
in teams. Don't kill the vibe by trying to manage it, but give people
the time, space and support to learn.

For many organisations, these approaches represent a significant
cultural shift, but it's a good shift. If these ideas are new to you,
think of them as the first step towards the culture of trust,
empowerment and autonomy your company needs to thrive in the digital
era.

- Hire developers at the start of the career, and mentor and support
  them.

- Build a culture of learning in your organisation.

- Support this culture through dedicated learning time, and
  Communities of Practice.

- Trust people to learn in their teams and communities.

## Your Funnel's Broken

Most organisations implement something like this model in their hiring
process.

TODO: funnel diagram

It's quite industrialised, and a little impersonal...but I understand
what drives it. You might see hiring as a time-consuming business, and
that it takes developers away from their "day jobs" to help with
technical interviewing. A cost. An overhead. A burden. Disruptive.

But if the thing that's preventing you from meeting your
organisational goals is not having the right people, then this really
is the problem you need to focus on<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>. It takes time
to select the right people to come and work in your team, but if you
get the right approach, and get your developers interviewing
candidates, it can scale up pretty well.

One final thought on this before we revisit in the next installment.
We tend to think of this funnel in a positive light : "we're going
forward with the candidates we're most confident in". What we think
about a lot *less* is this fact : __the vast majority of decisions we
make about candidates are made when we know the least about them.__

When we get to Episode 2, we'll cover screening techniques, and how we
can keep the process as lean as we can, but also avoid missing out on
potentially great candidates.

- Hiring the right people is going to take time, but there's nothing
  more important for your organisation than the people you choose.

- Screen to keep the process moving, but take a holistic, balanced
  view of the candidate.

## Communicate, But Don't Specify

You don't have to look far for terrible role specifications, and I
won't inflict any on you here. Most job specifications for developer
roles are endless laundry-lists of technologies, frameworks, languages
and platforms. They're low-level specifications for machines, not
people.

But some companies get this __very right__. Here's an example of a
recent open role from FanDuel for an entry-level mobile
developer. Right at the heading of the page, there's this statement:

> "We don’t want employees, we want player coaches – empowered to make
their own decisions, learn from mistakes and execute what works."

Excellent: an organisation that expects people to act, learn and
adapt. They go on to describe the organisation. This is a good thing,
and necessary. Then they go on to describe the role. I've chosen my
words carefully here : they *describe* the role, they don't *specify*
it.

> What does an Entry Level Mobile Engineer do
>
> You’ll learn to add features, change interactions, and fix bugs in
> our award winning apps. You will be working with your mentor, other
> engineers, designers and product owners, learning about and
> contributing at every stage of the of the product lifecycle, from
> research and discovery to iterative development, rollout and
> long-term maintenance.

This is great. It gives a flavour not just of the the tools and the
technology, but also of the people and the team dynamic. And then, oh
lordy, this:

> What you can expect
>
> - A six-month training programme, tailored to your needs, to get you
>   shipping code in our mobile apps.
> - A mentor to help you find your way.
> - An introduction to unit testing, pair programming, and tools such as
>   Git.
> - A supportive, trusting, and open work environment.
> - Work on a variety of projects (though not all at the same time).
> - Learn from others, and be a coach and mentor to other developers,
>   irrespective of experience.
> - 10% time to dedicate to personal projects.
> - Regular hack days.
> - A personal development budget for training and events and support
>   and encouragement to submit talks if you want to.

I'm almost crying at this point. They've managed to communicate a
sense of their values and their culture, as well as the specific ways
that people are supported.

## Plan Ahead

Think up front. If you don't, you'll end up with candidates sitting
pensively in reception, while you scrabble around upstairs trying to
figure out how to do a tech interview. This is not a good look.

TODO: rework

Someone will produce a grubby handful of A4 sheets (triumphantly,
always triumphantly : there's usually an "aha!" involved). Yes, this
is the time-honoured tech interview questions list. Every organisation
has one : dog-eared, coffee-stained, grubby and mildewed, a museum
piece of technical minutiae, corner cases and trick questions,
deprecated APIs and obsolete practices.

This the interviewing tool of last resort, and you're better than
that.

Most importantly, *tell candidates what the process is*. The format of
technical interviews should never be a surprise to people. They
shouldn't even need to ask. Make it clear on your website, restate in
any email communication, and invite people to email or call you if
they need clarification on any part of the process.

Remember also that proportionality is important, and that you need to
get technical interviewing right for the experience level of the
candidate. If you're specifically hiring early careers candidates for
a specific role, putting these candidates into the exact same process
you use for experienced candidates is not going to give you a fair
view of their ability and potential. You need to calibrate the
difficulty level of challenges, and consider skipping or replacing
some steps.

## Coming Next
Most organisations find that they need to have some kind of screening
stage. In the next post, we're going to look different tech screening
tools and techniques, and figure out how to get the best out of them,
for both you and the candidate.
